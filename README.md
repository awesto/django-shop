# Breaking News

After many month of hard work, version 0.9 of **djangoSHOP** has been finally released.
Please [Read the Docs](http://django-shop.readthedocs.org/en/) for additional information.

Version 0.9 is a complete rewrite of the old code base, which was frozen as version 0.2.1. The
[old documentation is available here](http://django-shop.readthedocs.org/en/0.2.1/).

Version 0.9 of **djangoSHOP** keeps the concepts of model overriding and cart modifiers. Therefore
with some effort, it should be possible to migrate existing projects to this new release. Please
contact me, if you need help.

To get a first impression on **djangoSHOP**, try out the three full working demo projects.
Following the instructions  ``docs/tutorial/intro.rst`` and ``docs/tutorial/quickstart.rst``
should create a running shop in minutes, prefilled with a dozen of products.
You can even pay by credit card, if you apply for your own testing account at Stripe.

I'd be happy to get some feedback.


# django SHOP

This version of django-shop is currently used to implement real e-commerce sites. If you want
to help out, please have a look at our development documentation in ``docs/contributing.rst``.

DjangoSHOP aims to be a the easy, fun and fast shop counterpart to django CMS.

Specifically, we aim at providing a clean, modular and Pythonic/Djangonic implementation of a shop
framework, that a moderately talented Django programmer should be able to pick up and run easily.


## Build status

### Todo:

* We need more tests.
* We need translations into other natural languages.
* The documentation should be checked by a native English speaker.
