        Adds a (new) product to the cart.

        The parameter `merge`, controls wheter we should merge the added
        CartItem with another already existing sharing the same
        product_id. This is useful when you have products with variations
        (for example), and you don't want to have your products merge (to loose
        their specific variations, for example).

        A drawback is, that generally  setting `merge` to ``False`` for products
        with variations can be a problem if users can buy thousands of products
        at a time (that would mean we would create thousands of CartItems as
        well which all have the same variation).

        The parameter `queryset` can be used to override the standard queryset
        that is being used to find the CartItem that should be merged into.
        If you use variations, just finding the first CartItem that
        belongs to this cart and the given product is not sufficient. You will
        want to find the CartItem that already has the same variations that the
        user chose for this request.

        >>> self.items[0] = CartItem.objects.create(..., product=MyProduct())
