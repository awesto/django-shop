Version 0.0.10
==============

* New hooks were added to cart modifiers: pre_process_cart and
  post_process_cart.
* [API change] Cart modifiers cart item methods now recieve a state object,
  that allows them to pass information between cart modifiers cheaply.
* The cart items are not automatically saved after  process_cart_item anymore.
  This allows for cart modifiers that change the cart's content (also
  deleting).
* Changed the version definition mechanism. You can now: import shop;
  shop.__version__. Also, it now conforms to PEP 386
* [API Change] Changed the payment backend API to let get_finished_url 
  and get_cancel_url return strings instead of HttpResponse objects (this 
  was confusing)
* Tests for the shop are now runnable from any project

Version 0.0.9
=============

* Changed the base class for Cart Modifiers. Methods are now expected to return
  a tuple, and not direectly append it to the extra_price_fields. Computation of
  the total is not done using an intermediate "current_total" attribute.
* Added a SHOP_FORCE_LOGIN setting that restricts the checkout process to
  loged-in users.

Version 0.0.8
=============

* Major change in the way injecting models for extensibility works: the base
  models are now abstract, and the shop provides a set of default implementations
  that users can replace / override using the settings, as usual. A special
  mechanism is required to make the Foreign keys to shop models work. This is
  explained in shop.utils.loaders

Version 0.0.7
=============

* Fixed bug in the extensibility section of CartItem
* Added complete German translations
* Added verbose names to the Address model in order to have shipping and 
  billing forms that has multilingual labels.

Version 0.0.6
=============

(Bugfix release)

* Various bugfixes
* Creating AddressModels for use with the checkout view (the default ones at
  least) were bugged, and would spawn new instances on form post, instead of
  updating the user's already existing ones.
* Removed redundant payment method field on the Order model.
* The "thank you" view does not crash anymore when it's refreshed. It now
  displays the last order the user placed.
* Fixed a bug in the shippingbilling view where the returned form was a from
  class instead of a from instance.

Version 0.0.5
=============

* Fix a bug in 0.0.4 that made South migration fail with Django < 1.3

Version 0.0.4
=============

* Created new mechanism to use custom Address models (see docs)
