django SHOP
===========

This repository hosts the django SHOP code and documentation.

Django SHOP aims to be the easy, fun and fast shop counterpart to django CMS.
Specifically, we aim at providing a clean, modular and pythonic/djangonic
implementation of a shop framework,
that a moderately talented Django programmer should be able to pick up and run
easily.

The current state is a roughly functional and highly modular system.
Please refer to docs/plugins.rst to figure out what plugin types are available,
and what the do

You'll find the detailed doc on
`RTD <http://readthedocs.org/projects/django-shop/>`_

How to help:
============

* Development is done on github - please fork!
* Most of the discussion around architecture decisions / tools etc... take
  place on IRC (Freenode), on #django-shop
* Pick a task from the list below :)

Todo:
=====

* Somebody should kickstart an example shop application using django SHOP, to
  use as an example.
* If you feel like adding templates, please *refrain* from adding fancy styling
  to the core set of templates.
  Styling is awesome, and everybody wants a good looking shop, but it should go
  in example apps, not in core shop :)
  Also, please keep templates to the main templates directory only (so that
  people have a clear view of the templates structure)
* Writing docs is most welcome :)
* Refactoring tests to make creating test environments less messy (fixtures?)
* If you feel like you could solve having multiple currencies in an elegant
  manner, we would really be interested to hear from you
