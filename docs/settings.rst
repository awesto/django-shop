=================
General Settings
=================

This is a small list of the settings defined in django SHOP.

SHOP_PAYMENT_BACKENDS
======================

A list (or iterable) of payment backend class paths.
These classes will be used as the active payment backends by the checkout system,
and so anything in this list will be shown to the customer for him/her to make
a decision

SHOP_SHIPPING_BACKENDS
=======================

In a similar fashion, this must be a list of shipping backends. This list is used
to display to the end customer what shipping options are available to him/her during
the checkout process.

SHOP_CART_MODIFIERS
====================

These modifiers function like the django middlewares. The cart will call each of
these classes, in order, every time it is displayed. They are passed every item in
the cart, as well as the cart itself.

SHOP_FORCE_LOGIN
=================
If ``True``, all views after the :class:`~shop.views.cart.CartDetails` view will
need the user to be authenticated. An anonymous user will be redirected to your
login url. Please read more on authentication in Django's official
`authentication documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/>`_
.

==========================
Backend specific Settings
==========================

Some backends define extra settings to tweak their behavior. This should be an
exhaustive list of all of the backends and modifiers included in the trunk of
django SHOP.

SHOP_SHIPPING_FLAT_RATE
========================
(Optional)
The "flat rate" shipping module uses this to know how much to charge. This
should be a string, and will be converted to a Decimal by the backend. 

=======================
Extensibility Settings
=======================

Theses settings allow developers to extend the shop's functionality by replacing
models with their own models. More information on how to use these settings
can be found in the :doc:`/howto/how-to-extend-django-shop-models` section.

SHOP_CART_MODEL
================
(Optional)
A python classpath to the class you want to replace the Cart model with.
Example value: `myproject.models.MyCartModel`

SHOP_ADDRESS_MODEL
===================
(Optional)
A python classpath to the class you want to replace the
:class:`shop.addressmodel.models.Address` model with. See
:doc:`/howto/how-to-use-your-own-addressmodel` for a more complete example.

Example value: `myproject.models.MyAddressModel`

SHOP_ORDER_MODEL
=================
(Optional)
A python classpath to the class you want to replace the
:class:`shop.models.Order` model with.

Example value: `myproject.models.MyOrderModel`
