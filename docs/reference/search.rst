Full Text Search
================

How should a customer find the product he desires in a more or less unstructured collection of
countless products? Hierarchical navigation often doesn't work and takes too much time. Thanks to
the way we use the Internet today, most site visitors expect one central search field inside, or
nearby the main navigation bar of a site.


Search Engine API
=================

While it is possible to adopt other search backends to **django-SHOP** with little effort, this
documentation focuses exclusively on Elasticsearch_.

Until version 1.1, **django-SHOP** used Haystack_. Haystack is a great third party app for Django
and easy to adapt for full-text search. Unfortunately, Haystack was never adopted to versions
of Elasticsearch beyond 1.7. Also, it didn't allow complicated queries and the configuration is
minimal and highly restricted. Therefore, **django-SHOP** version 1.2 has been refactored to use
elasticsearch-dsl_ together with django-elasticsearch-dsl_. It now supports up to the most recent
version of Elasticsearch, which currently is 7.6.

In this document we assume that the merchant only wants to index his products, but not any arbitrary
content, such as for example the "Terms and Conditions" page, as found outside **django-SHOP**, but
usually inside **django-CMS**. Indexing CMS pages using Elasticsearch would be perfectly feasible,
but is not the topic of this documentation.


Configuration
-------------

Download and install the latest version of the Elasticsearch binary. During development, all tests
have been performed with version 7.5. After unzipping the file, start Elasticsearch in daemon mode
by invoking:

:samp:`./path/to/elasticsearch-{version}/bin/elasticsearch -d`.

Check if the server answers on HTTP requests. Pointing a browser on
`http://localhost:9200/ <http://localhost:9200/>`_ should return something similar to this:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ curl http://localhost:9200/
	{
	  "name" : "Ape-X",
	  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
	  "cluster_uuid" : "P9HVZRPbUXjTEDO9iZHGDk",
	  "version" : {
	    â€¦
	  }
	}

Install ``elasticsearch-dsl`` and ``django-elasticsearch-dsl`` using

.. code-block:: shell

    pipenv install django-elasticsearch-dsl

In ``settings.py``, add ``'django_elasticsearch_dsl'`` to the list of ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
Configure the connection to the Elasticsearch database:

.. code-block:: python

	ELASTICSEARCH_DSL = {
	    'default': {
	        'hosts': 'localhost:9200',
	    },
	}


Indexing the Products
=====================

Before adding search support for products on our site, we must consider which fields of our product
model contain relevant information to be searched for. The philosophy of **django-SHOP** is to not
impose any predefined fields for this purpose, but rather let the merchants decide what they need.
Therefore it is quite important to spot the fields in the product models, which contain the relevant
information customers might search for.

Elasticsearch uses the term ``Document`` to describe a searchable entity. In **django-SHOP**, we
can define one or more product models, each declaring their own fields. Since in our e-commerce
site, we want to search over all products, regardless of their specific model definition, we need a
mapping from those fields onto the representation used to create the reverse index. For this
purpose, **django-SHOP** is shipped with a generic document class named ``ProductDocument``. It
contains three index fields: ``product_name``, ``product_code`` and ``body``.


Product Name
------------

The product's name often is declared as a ``CharField`` in our product's model. Depending on the
nature of the product, it could also be declared for different languages. Using django-parler's
``TranslatableField``, the product name then is stored in a Django model related to the product
model. We also want to ensure, that this name is indexed only for a specific language.

This information is stored inside the ``Document`` field: ``product_name``.


Product Code
------------

The product's code is the unique identifier of a product and is independant of the language.
However, in case a product is offerend in different variants, each of them may declare their own
product code. This means, that the same product can be found through one or more product codes.
Moreover, since product code are unique identifiers, we usually do not want to apply stemming.

They are stored as a list of keywords inside an Elasticsearch ``Document`` entity.


Body Field
----------

Depending on our product's model declaration, we can have many additional fields containing
information, which may be relevant for search. Therefore the merchant must declare a Django
template for each product type. This template then is used to render the content of those fields as
plain text. This text is never seen by humans, but rather is used to feed our full text search
engine when building the reverse index. First Elasticsearch strips all HTML tags from that text.
In the second step, this text is tokenized and stemmed by Elasticsearch analyzers. In
**django-SHOP** we shall specify one analyzer for each natural language.


Example
.......

Say, we have a product using this simplified model representation:

.. code-block:: python

	from django.db import models
	from shop.models.product import BaseProduct

	class Author(models.Model):
	    name = models.CharField(
	        "Author Name",
	        max_length=255,
	    )

	class Editor(models.Model):
	    name = models.CharField(
	        "Editor",
	        max_length=255,
	    )

	class Book(BaseProduct):
	    product_name = models.CharField(
	        "Book Title",
	        max_length=255,
	    )

	    product_code = models.CharField(
	        "Product code",
	        max_length=255,
	    )

	    caption = HTMLField(
	        help_text="Short description",
	    )

	    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)

	    editor = models.ForeignKey(
	        Editor,
	        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
	    )

By default, **django-SHOP**'s search functionality indexes only the fields ``product_name`` and
``product_code``. Usually we also want other fields beeing indexed, if they contain relevant
information. If say, the merchant's implementation is named ``awesome_bookstore``, then inside the
project's template folder, we must create a file named ``awesome_bookstore/search/indexes/book.txt``.
This template file then shall contain a structure similar to this:

.. code-block:: text
	:caption: awesome_bookstore/search/indexes/book.txt

	{{ product.caption }}
	{% for author in product.authors.all %}
	{{ author.name }}{% endfor %}
	{{ product.editor.name }}

When building the index, this template is rendered for each product offered by our bookstore.
The rendered content is passed directly to the search engine and serves to feed the Elasticsearch
database with a reverse index. Before importing, it is cleaned up, removing all HTML tags.
Afterwards it is tokenized into a list of separate words. These words then are stemmed, which
means that they are reduced to their basic meaning. The final step is to remove common words, such
as "or", "the", "is", "and" etc. This list of words is named "The Reverse Index" and is then stored
in the ``body`` field inside entities of type :class:`shop.search.documents.ProductDocument`.

.. note::
	If the above template file can not be found, **django-SHOP** falls back onto
	``awesome_bookstore/search/indexes/product.txt``. If that template file is missing too, then
	the file ``shop/search/indexes/product.txt`` is used. Note that the template file always is in
	lowercase.


Populate the Database
---------------------

To build the index in Elasticsearch, invoke ``./manage.py search_index --rebuild``. If German and
English are configured, then the output may look like:

.. code-block:: shell

	$ ./manage.py search_index --rebuild
	Deleting index 'awesome_bookstore.de.products'
	Deleting index 'awesome_bookstore.en.products'
	Creating index 'awesome_bookstore.de.products'
	Creating index 'awesome_bookstore.en.products'
	Indexing 986 'Product' objects
	Indexing 986 'Product' objects

Depending on the number of products in the database, this may take some time. Note, that only
products tagged as "active" are indexed. To check, if the product can be found in the index, point
a browser onto:

`http://localhost:9200/awesome_bookstore.en.products/_search?q=django&pretty <http://localhost:9200/awesome_bookstore.en.products/_search?q=django&pretty>`_.

If our awesome bookstore offers books whose title or caption text contains the word "Django", then
these books are listed as "hits" in the JSON response from Elasticsearch.


.. _reference/search-view:

Search View
===========

In order to show search results, we need a database filled with a reverse index. This is what we
have done in the previous section. This populated search database can be used for two kind of
purposes:

Generic search over all products and as an additional "search-as-you-type" filter, while rendering
the catalog's list view.


Search Apphook
--------------

As with all other pages in **django-SHOP**, the page displaying our search results is a normal CMS
page too. It is suggested to create this page on the root level of the page tree. As title for this
page we choose "*Search Results*" or something similar meaningful. Since we want to hide this page
from the menu navigation, we must disable its Menu visibility using the appropriate checkbox in the
CMS page tree admin.

We now change into the *Advanced Setting* of the page. There we set the page **ID** to
"``shop-search-product``". This identifier is required, so that the search functionality knows where
to render the search results. As **Application**, we select *Catalog Search* from the drop-down
menu. This selects the `django-CMS apphook`_ provided by **django-SHOP** for its catalog search.

.. note::
	The apphook *Catalog Search* must be registered by the merchant implementation. It's just as
	simple as registering :class:`shop.cms_apphooks.CatalogSearchApp` using the
	:meth:`menus.menu_pool.menu_pool.apphook_pool.register`.

As a template use one with a placeholder large enough to render the search results. The default
template shipped with **django-SHOP** usually is a good fit.

Now save the page and change into **Structure** mode. There locate the placeholder named
**Main Content** and add a Bootstrap Container plugin, followed by a Row and then a Column plugin.
As leaf child of that column, choose the **Search Results** plugin from section **Shop**. This
CMS plugin offers three pagination options:

* **Manual Paginator**: If searching generates too many results, add a paginator on the bottom of
  the page. The customer may scroll through those pages manually.
* **Manual Infinite**: If searching generates too many results, add a button on the bottom of
  the page. The customer load more results clicking on that button.
* **Auto Infinite**: If searching generates too many results, and the customer scrolls to the
  bottom of the page, more results are loaded automatically.

As with all other placeholders in **django-CMS**, you may add as many plugins together with the
**Search Results** plugin.

Finally publish the page and enter some text into the search field. This should render a list of
found products.

|product-search-results|

.. |product-search-results| image:: /_static/product-search-results.png


Adopting the Templates
......................

Search results are displayed using a wrapper template responsible for rendering a list of found
items. The default template can be found in ``shop/templates/shop/search/results.html``. It can
be replaced or extended by a customized template in the merchant implementation, namely
:samp:`{app_label}/templates/{app_label}/search/results.html` [#app_label]_. In our bookstore
example this template would be named
``awesome_bookstore/templates/awesome_bookstore/search/results.html``.

Since each of the found items may be from a different product type, we can provide a snippet
template for each of them. This allows us to display the given list in a polymorphic way, so that
each product type can provide its own way how to be rendered. That snippet template is looked up
following these rules:

* :samp:`{app_label}/templates/{app_label}/products/search-{product-model-name}-media.html`
  [#app_label]_, [#product-model-name]_
* :samp:`{app_label}/templates/{app_label}/products/search-product-media.html` [#app_label]_
* :samp:`shop/templates/shop/products/search-product-media.html`

This means that the template to render the products's detail view is selected automatically
depending on its product type.

.. [#app_label] *app_label* is the app label of the project in lowercase.
.. [#product-model-name] *product-model-name* is the class name of the product model in lowercase.


.. _reference/search-autocompletion-catalog:

Autocompletion in Catalog List View
-----------------------------------

As we have seen in the previous example, the Product Search View is suitable to search for any item
in the product database. Sometimes the site visitor might just refine the list of items shown in the
catalog's list view. Here, loading a new page which uses a layout able to render every kind of
product usually differs from the catalog's list layout, and hence may by inappropriate.

Instead, when someone enters some text into the search field, **django-SHOP** starts to narrow down
the list of items in the default catalog's list view by typing query terms into the search field.
This is specially useful in situations where hundreds of products are displayed together on the same
page and the customer want to pick out the correct one by entering some search terms.

To extend the existing Catalog List View for autocompletion, locate the file ``cms_apps.py`` in
the merchant implementation. There we add a special search filter to our existing product list view.
This could be implemented as:

.. code-block:: python
	:caption: awesome_bookstore/cms_apps.py
	:emphasize-lines: 10

	from cms.apphook_pool import apphook_pool
	from shop.cms_apphooks import CatalogListCMSApp
	from shop.rest.filters import CMSPagesFilterBackend

	class CatalogListApp(CatalogListCMSApp):
	    def get_urls(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
	        from shop.search.mixins import ProductSearchViewMixin
	        from shop.views.catalog import AddToCartView, ProductListView, ProductRetrieveView

	        bases = (ProductSearchViewMixin, ProductListView)
	        ProductSearchListView = type('SearchView', bases, {})
	        filter_backends = [CMSPagesFilterBackend]
	        filter_backends.extend(api_settings.DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS)
	        return [
	            url(r'^(?P<slug>[\w-]+)/add-to-cart', AddToCartView.as_view()),
	            url(r'^(?P<slug>[\w-]+)', ProductRetrieveView.as_view()),
	            url(r'^', ProductSearchListView.as_view(
	                filter_backends=filter_backends,
	            )),
	        ]

	apphook_pool.register(CatalogListApp)

In this apphook, we create the class ``ProductSearchListView`` on the fly. It actually just adds
the mixin :class:`shop.search.mixins.ProductSearchViewMixin` to the existing
:ref:`reference/catalog-list`. This class extends the internal filters by one, which also consults
the Elasticsearch database if we filter the product against a given query request.


The Client Side
===============

To facilitate the placement of the search input field, **django-SHOP** ships with the reusable
AngularJS directive named ``shopProductSearch``. It is declared inside the module
``shop/js/search-form.js``.

A HTML snipped with a submission form using this directive can be found in the shop's templates
folder at ``shop/navbar/search-form.html``. If you override it, make sure that the ``<form...>``
tag uses the directive ``shop-product-search`` as attribute:

.. code-block:: django

	<form shop-product-search method="get" action="/url-of-page-rendering-the-search-results">
	  <input name="q" ng-model="searchQuery" ng-change="autocomplete()" type="text" />
	</form>

If you don't use the prepared HTML snippet, assure that the module is initialized while
bootstrapping our Angular application:

.. code-block:: javascript

	angular.module('myShop', [..., 'django.shop.search', ...]);
