Designing an Address Model
==========================

Depending on the merchant's needs, the business model and the catchment area of the site, the used
address models may vary widely. Since **djangoSHOP** allows to subclass almost every database model,
addresses are no exception here. The class :class:`shop.models.address.BaseAddress` only contains
a foreign key to the Customer model and a priority field used to sort multiple addresses by
relevance.

Create a Customized Address Model
=================================

All the fields which make up an address, such as the addressee, the street name, zip code, etc. are
part of the concrete model implementing an address. It is the merchant's responsibility to define
which address fields are required for his needs. Therefore the base address model does not contain
any address related fields, they instead have to be declared by the merchant. A concrete
implementation of the shipping address model may look like this:

.. code-block:: python

	from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _
	from shop.models.address import BaseShippingAddress, ISO_3166_CODES

	class ShippingAddress(BaseShippingAddress):
	    name = models.CharField(_("Full name"), max_length=1024)
	    address1 = models.CharField(_("Address line 1"), max_length=1024)
	    address2 = models.CharField(_("Address line 2"), max_length=1024)
	    zip_code = models.CharField(_("ZIP / Postal code"), max_length=12)
	    city = models.CharField(_("City"), max_length=1024)
	    country = models.CharField(_("Country"), max_length=3,
	                               choices=ISO_3166_CODES)
	    class Meta:
	        verbose_name = "Shipping Address"
	        verbose_name_plural = "Shipping Addresses"


Since the billing address may contain different fields, it must be defined separately from the
shipping address. To avoid the duplicate definition of common fields for both models, use a mixin
class such as:

.. code-block:: python

	from django.db import models
	from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _
	from shop.models.address import BaseBillingAddress

	class AddressModelMixin(models.Model):
	    name = models.CharField(_"Full name"), max_length=1024)
	    address1 = models.CharField(_"Address line 1"), max_length=1024)
	    # other fields

	    class Meta:
	        abstract = True


	class BillingAddress(BaseBillingAddress, AddressModelMixin):
	    tax_number = models.CharField("Tax number", max_length=50)

	    class Meta:
	        verbose_name = _("Billing Address")
	        verbose_name_plural = _("Billing Addresses")


The Default Address Model
-------------------------

The simplest way is to materialize the required address classes, is to use them from our default
and convenience models: :class:`shop.models.defaults.address.ShippingAddress` and
:class:`shop.models.defaults.address.BillingAddress`. Before using them, please check if they
fulfill your requirements.


Multiple Addresses
==================

In **djangoSHOP**, if the merchant activates this feature, while setting up the site, customers
can register more than one address. Multiple addresses can be activated, when editing the
**Shipping Address Form Plugin** or the **Billing Address Form Plugin**.

Then during checkout, the customer can select one of a previously entered shipping- and
billing addresses, or if he desires add a new one to his list of existing addresses.


How Addresses are used
======================

Each active ``Cart`` object refers to one shipping address object and optionally one billing address
object. This means that the customer can change those addresses whenever he uses the supplied
address forms.

However, when the customer purchases the content of the cart, that address object is converted into
a simple text string and stored inside the then created ``Order`` object. This is to freeze the
actual wording of the entered address. It also assures that the address used for delivery and
printed on the invoice is immune against accidental changes after the purchasing operation.


Use Shipping Address for Billing
================================

Most customers use their shipping address for billing. Therefore, unless you have really special
needs, it is suggested to share all address fields required for shipping, also with the billing
address. The customer then can reuse the shipping address for billing, if he desires to.
Technically, if the billing address is unset, the shipping address is used anyway, but in
**djangoSHOP** the merchant has to actively give permission to his customers, to reuse this address
for billing.

The merchant has to actively allow this setting on the site, while editing the **Billing Address
Form Plugin**.


Address Formatting
==================

Whenever the customer fulfills the purchase operation, the corresponding shipping- and billing
address objects are rendered into a short paragraph of plain text, separated by the newline
character. This formatted address then is used to print address labels for parcel delivery
and printed invoices.

It is the merchant's responsibility to format these addresses according to the local practice.
A customized address template must be added into the merchant's implementation below the
``templates`` folder named ``myshop/shipping_address.txt`` or ``myshop/billing_address.txt``.
If both address models share the same fields, we may also use ``myshop/address.txt`` as a fallback.
Such an address template may look like:

.. code-block:: django
	:caption: myshop/address.txt

	{{ address.name }}
	{{ address.address1 }}{% if address.address2 %}
	{{ address.address2 }}
	{% endif %}
	{{ address.zip_code }} {{ address.city }}
	{{ address.get_country_display }}

This template is used by the method ``as_text()`` as found in each address model.


Address Forms
=============

The address form, where customers can insert their address, is generated automatically and in a DRY
manner. This means that whenever a field is added, modified or removed from the address model, the
corresponding fields in the address input form, reflect those changes without manual intervention.
When creating the form template, we have to write it using the ``as_div()`` method. This method
also adds automatic client-side form validation to the corresponding HTML code.


Address Form Styling
--------------------

One problem which remains with automatic form generation, is how to style the input fields.
Therefore, **djangoSHOP** wraps every input field into a ``<div>``-element using a CSS class named
according to the field. This for instance is useful to shorten some input fields and/or place it
onto the same line.

Say, any of our address forms contain the fields ``zip_code`` and ``location`` as shown in the
example above. Then they may be styled as

.. code-block:: css

	.shop-address-zip_code {
	  width: 35%;
	  display: inline-block;
	}

	.shop-address-city {
	  width: 65%;
	  display: inline-block;
	  margin-left: -4px;
	  padding-left: 15px;
	}

so that the ZIP field is narrower and precedes the location field on the same line.
