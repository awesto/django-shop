Shipping Providers
==================

Unless you use the merchant management systems for delivery, **django-SHOP** provides some hooks to
add shipping providers. Shipping providers require that the Delivery model is available, otherwise
there is no way to keep track which items have been shipped with a delivery.

Version 0.13 has a complete and working implementation for a shipping provider.
